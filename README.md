## Problem Statement

This project aims to design a prediction model using the IBM HR Analytics Attrition dataset to recognize the factors affecting the employee attrition rate. A high attrition rate can negatively impact company productivity, recruitment costs, and the company's ability to retain employees.
    

## Objective

The objectives of this model are:
- Identifying the main factors contributing to the employee attrition rate.
- Analyzing patterns and trends in the data to understand the behavior of employees likely to leave the company.
- Developing a predictive model that can predict the likelihood of future employee attrition based on the attributes in the dataset.
    

## Methods Used
Various data preprocessing and modeling techniques were used in this notebook. The methods include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the application of machine learning models to predict employee attrition. Specific algorithms and libraries used will be detailed in the actual notebook.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository containing this notebook.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab installed.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the notebook.
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and open the notebook.
5. Execute the cells sequentially to understand the content and perform the analysis.
