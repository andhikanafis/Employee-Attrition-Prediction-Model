# Andhika Nafis Notebook: Employee Attrition Model Prediction    


## Data
The data used is the IBM HR Analytics Attrition dataset. This dataset includes various employee attributes such as age, education, position, etc.


## Problem Statement

High attrition rates can negatively impact a company's productivity, recruitment costs, and ability to retain talent. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the factors influencing this attrition.

    
## Objective

The objectives of this model are:
- Identifying the main factors contributing to the employee attrition rate.
- Analyzing patterns and trends in the data to understand the behavior of employees likely to leave the company.
- Developing a predictive model that can predict the likelihood of future employee attrition based on the attributes in the dataset.


## Technology Stack
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Imbalanced-Learn
- Jupyter Notebook


## Methods Used
The methods used include:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data preprocessing, including encoding and scaling
- Development of classification models using algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, and SVM
- Model evaluation using metrics like F1 score, accuracy, precision, and recall


## Project Output
The output of this project is a predictive model that can be used to predict the likelihood of employee attrition based on the attributes present in the dataset.
